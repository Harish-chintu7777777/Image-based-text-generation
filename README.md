• Created a project that focuses on generating captions for given input images.
<br>
• constructed a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.
<br>
• After Data Peprocessing, Feature extraction is done using the VGG16 model and captions are generated using LSTM layers.
<br>
• The model successfully generates captions for input images, and the results are visualized to assess the performance.
